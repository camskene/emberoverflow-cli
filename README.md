# emberoverflow-cli

This repo is the result of reading 'Ambitious Ember Applications - A Comprehensive Ember.js Tutorial' by Ruslan Yakhyaev and building the app as instructed in said book.

The official repo for the book can be found [here](https://github.com/ryakh/emberoverflow-cli). Directions to install and run the app can be found there.

This app needs an API to run. A simple server built for the purposes of this book can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/ryakh/emberoverflow-server).

The same app built _without_ ember-cli can be found in [this](https://github.com/camskene/emberoverflow-sk) repo.
